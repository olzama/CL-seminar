📚 [Partially annotated bibliography](annotated_bib.md)

💡 [Discussion](https://github.com/olzama/CL-seminar/discussions) (you'll need a GitHub account)


In Spring 2021, I declared a graduate seminar 🎓 as part of the "Problems in Linguistics" series at UW Linguistics. Three awesome ✨ graduate students enrolled, one computer science, one computational linguistics, and one linguistics student. Together, we had a lot of fun discussing the history 🏛️, the present 🕸️, and the future ❓ of the field of computational linguistics. One of the outcomes of the seminar was an [annotated bibliography](annotated_bib.md) 📚 which we would now like to share 🌐 with the world! 

NB: the materials 📚 listed in the bibliography certainly fill up a 10-week 🗓️ seminar (that meets once a week for 2.5 hours), and perhaps easily twice 🗓️🗓️ as much. We only found time to discuss some of the material.
