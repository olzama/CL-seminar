In Spring 2021, I declared a graduate seminar as part of the "Problems in Linguistics" series at UW Linguistics. Three awesome graduate students enrolled, one computer science, one computational linguistics, and one linguistics student. Together, we had a lot of fun discussing the history, the present, and the future of the field of computational linguistics. One of the outcomes of the seminar was an annotated bibliography which we would now like to share with the world!

Please feel free to discuss and make suggestions!
